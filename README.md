PA session 3

Modeling a 1D particle under the effect of a force
A scatter change of 0.05 is added which resets the velocity of the particle to zero
The top plot the velocity with respect to time with the average (drift) velocity shown on the plot and in the title
The middle plot shows the position with respect to time
The bottom plot shows the velocity with respect to position
